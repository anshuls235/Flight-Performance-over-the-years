# Summary
For this project, I have downloaded the flight arrival data from the bureau of transportation statistics ranging from June 2003 - December 2017. The dataset cab be found on the following website:

https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?pn=1 

I have created visualizations in Tableau which answer the following questions:

Which states in the US have received the most air traffic and how it is spatially distributed over the years, months , carrier , towns or even airports?
What has been the flight trend and how many flights have been On Time , Delayed, Cancelled and Diverted and how are they distributed over the years and further levels of granularity?
Which State in the US has had the worst Delayed flight percent of the Total flights arrived?
What percent of the total flights have arrived On Time or have been delayed, cancelled or diverted and can these be analysed for any carrier?
What are the various reasons for flight delays and what is the share of each reason over the years and for any carrier?
